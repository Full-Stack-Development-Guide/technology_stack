Why should you attend?

Your services will be battle-tested and a public proof of your work will be generated that will demonstrate that you performed on a high quality bar and know how to maintain services reliably.

If you are a student, do you want to walk into an interview and say “I know data structures”, OR “I have deployed, upgraded and managed backend services that can handle upto 2000 API requests per second while keeping costs low, here is the API test suite & reports.”
